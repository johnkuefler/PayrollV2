Payroll meetings notes 10/7/2019

* We are adding a new deduction option for dining meals
* If an employee opts into this deduction, they pay $20 per pay period to have up to 5 meals at the cafeteria per week
* Whether or not this deduction is availabxle for an employee will live in our cloud based ERP system as a true/false flag entered by HR
* Anyone who does not opt into the dining deduction should have their pay calculated the same still
* Dining deduction is always before taxes
